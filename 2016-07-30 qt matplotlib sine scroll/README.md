# GUI demo: live data display with PyQT4, matplotlib, and MatplotlibWidget

This is a minimal-case example how to get a PyQt4 GUI (designed with QT Designer) to display a matploblit widget and update it automatically. This was tested with the WinPython 3.x distribution, but should be cross platform.

* run go.py to launch the program (pulling UI from ui_main.py)
* I made ui_main.ui with Qt Designer, then ran ui_convert.py to convert the .ui to .py
